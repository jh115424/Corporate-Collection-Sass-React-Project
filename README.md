# React + Vite

README:
"I built this luxury office e-commerce site to practice SASS, React Router, and JavaScript while creating something professional I can show to potential employers. The site showcases high-end office furniture and accessories for modern corporate spaces.
What it does:

Two-page site with React Router navigation
Home page with featured products
Product grid page with filtering/sorting functionality
Professional corporate design with clean, minimalist layout
Interactive product cards with hover effects and add-to-cart functionality

Tech stack:

React with useState for state management
React Router for navigation between pages
SASS for styling (variables, nesting, mixins)
JavaScript for product filtering, sorting, and interactive features
Component-based architecture
Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts

The design approach:
I went with a professional color palette using muted blues, grays, and neutrals to create a sophisticated corporate aesthetic. Used SASS variables for the color scheme so the entire site's look can be adjusted easily. The layout is inspired by Amplitude's clean, user-friendly design - emphasizing clarity and straightforward navigation.
Features I implemented:

Product filtering by category and price range
Sorting options for products
Interactive add-to-cart buttons
Responsive design that works on all devices
Reusable product card components

Challenges I solved:

Setting up React Router for multi-page navigation
Managing state across components for cart/filter functionality
Organizing SASS files with proper structure and naming conventions
Creating dynamic product displays based on user interactions
Building a professional UI that balances aesthetics with usability

This project was a step up from my previous work because it combines routing, SASS preprocessing, JavaScript logic for interactivity, and real UX considerations. It's something I'd confidently include in a portfolio to demonstrate I can build functional, professional-looking applications.
